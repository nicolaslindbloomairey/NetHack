    DragaeraHack

NOTE: all things Dragaera belong to Steven Brust

This Nethack variant is intended to mostly be a reskin of vanilla
with a few of my own quality of life changes and a couple ideas.

Changes made:

Planned changes:
  reskin
  - add in dragaera monsters and remove many vanilla ones
  - add in 18 new roles, one for each house plus easterner
  - races are dragearan or human
  - only jhereg and teckla gets to play as both races
  - new goal, recover the imperial orb from paths of dead instead of amulet of yendor from gehennom
  - ascend to emperor/empress instead of demigod?
  - change spells, easterner gets unique spells

  misc ideas
  - make blessed identify more reliable
  - add the hunger counter to the status lines
  - sokoban longer, more variable, more prizes
